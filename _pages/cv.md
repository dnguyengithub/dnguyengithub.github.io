## Education
* <strong>Ph.D.</strong> in Machine Learning (Deep Learning), <a href="https://www.imt-atlantique.fr">IMT Atlantique</a>, 2020 (expected)
* <strong>M.S.</strong> (<strong>summa cum laude</strong>) in Signal and Image Processing, <a href="https://www.univ-rennes1.fr/">University of Rennes 1</a>, 2017
* <strong>Diplôme d'Ingénieur</strong> in Machine Learning, <a href="https://www.imt-atlantique.fr">IMT Atlantique</a>, 2017


## Work experience & professional activities
* 02/2020-03/2020: <strong>Visiting fellow</strong>, <a href="https://www.cls.fr/en/cls-group">CLS (Collecte Localisation Satellites)</a>
  * Worked with AIS experts at CLS to evaluate my research prototype---<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.00682.pdf">GeoTrackNet</a>: on real-life data: tested the limits of the model, explained the results.
  * Discussed with engineers at CLS to integrate GeoTrackNet into CLS's Big data system <a href="https://maritime-intelligence.groupcls.com/integrated-solutions/maritime-awareness-system">MAS (Maritime Awareness System)</a>: how to run the model in a distributed system and in real-time.

* 09/2019-11/2019: <strong>Visiting graduate student</strong>, <a href="https://bigdata.cs.dal.ca">Dalhousie Institute for Big Data Analytics</a>
  * Created a deep learning model to detect sablefish from maritime passive acoustic data.
  * The detector is under consideration for being used in real-life by Canadian marine biologists. 

* 05/2019-06/2019: <strong>Visiting graduate student</strong>, <a href="https://www.engr.washington.edu">University of Washington, College of Engineering</a>
  * Established the collaboration between the University of Washington College of Engineering and IMT Atlantique.
  
* 09/2018-11/2018: <strong>Visiting graduate student</strong>, <a href="https://bigdata.cs.dal.ca">Dalhousie Institute for Big Data Analytics</a>
  * Created a deep learning model to detect abnormal events in acoustic surveillance using Recurrent neural networks with stochastic layers.
  
* 03/2017-09/2017: <strong>Engineering intern</strong>, <a href="https://www.cls.fr/en/cls-group">CLS (Collecte Localisation Satellites)</a>
  * Made statistic reports of the fusion of SAR and AIS data for maritime traffic surveillance.
  * Improved the software that combines SAR and AIS data for maritime traffic surveillance.
  * Finished the task 1.5 months ahead of schedule with excellent results.

* 07/2016-03/2017: <strong>Research intern</strong>, <a href="https://www.inserm.fr">INSERM (Institut national de la santé et de la recherche médicale)</a>
  * Evaluated the resolution and the precision of 3D ultrasound.
  
* 06/2015-08/2015: <strong>Research intern</strong>, <a href="https://www.siit.tu.ac.th">Thammasat University, SIIT</a>
  * Impoved the glistening detection software using Tabu search - kNN and Neural Network.
