I am a PhD Candidate at <a href="https://www.imt-atlantique.fr">IMT Atlantique</a> and a research scientist at <a href="https://www.lab-sticc.fr">Lab-STICC</a> in the field of <strong>Machine Learning (Deep Learning)</strong>. My research interests focus on <strong>time series analysis</strong>, especially on modeling stochastic, noisy and irregularly sampled data using variational deep learning approaches.
